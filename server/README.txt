These are the php scripts called by the Android LaborStatistics app.

Before these scripts will work, the PostgreSQL database must be populated following the instructions in the "database" directory.

Also each php script in this directory will have to have the following variables set to be valid:
   $host - host of the PostgreSQL database (for example localhost)
   $user - PostgreSQL user account
   $pass - PostgreSQL user password
   $database - PostgreSQL database name
